# Shell Config

This repo contains the configuration files for shell setups as used for my device. I don't mention the steps to incorporate them into a system as they are readily available online. The exact setup requires a little effort, so I am sharing the scripts.

## Files

- [.bashrc](): Startup Script for **bash** Shell (I used bash earlier).

- [.zshrc](): Startup Script for **zsh** Shell (Currently in use).

- [.vimrc](): Startup Script for **vim** Editor.

- [.p10k.zsh](): File for the **zsh theme**. I use the [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme for my **zsh**.
